    roomName: Eli's Basement
    roomDescription: |-
      the basement is a converted root cellar, with a small stool bolted to the floor
      it is not a comforting room and reminds you of far to many movies that you probably never should have watched
      the light is just enough that you don't have to see too much.
      it smells damp and somehow of bad faith.
