    roomDescription: |-
      the barn is old and smells of old hay and oddly dissolution
      the floor is dirt and trampled dried horse shit scattered with straw and broken bottles
      the smell is not unpleasent and reminds you faintly of petrol and old socks

    roomName: Walking Eagle Pass
    roomDescription: |-
      it winds through the mountains, the path is treacherous
      toilet papered trees cover the steep
      valley sides below you.
      On closer inspection the TP might
      be the remains of a cricket team
      or perhaps a lost and very dead KKK picnic group.
      It's brass monkeys.

    roomName: Bensons plain
    roomDescription: |-
      the plain reaches seemingly endlessly to the sky in all directions
      and the sky itself feels greasy and cold.
      pyramidal rough shapes dot the horizin and land which
      upon closer examination are made from bufalo skulls.
      The air tastes of grease and bensons.
      happy happy happy
