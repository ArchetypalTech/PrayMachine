# The Alley Off Main Street

the alley composed of stinking mud sits between main street and the praries, seems that

the town uses uses it as dump, for both iscared humans and discarded, well, literal shit.

all in all not somewhere wants to linger unless dead, or drunk and in that case probably

best to be dead drunk. 

oddly it reminds you of home. this isnt a good thing.
